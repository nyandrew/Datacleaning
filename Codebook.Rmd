Code book for data clean in UCI HAR Dataset
========================================================

This is a code book for the tidy data set which is processed from the Raw data set "UCI HAR Dataset".
There are 68 variables and 180 records in the tidy data set which are extracted from the raw data set.
This data set includes every subject and every motion's mean measurements from two sensors.
According to the requirements, I did the following changes on the data set.
1.Combine the subject ID and activities ID into the data set for both train set and test set.(activites is in the Y_train.txt/Y_test.txt, subject ID is in the subject_train.txt/subject_test.txt, the data sets is X_train.txt/X_test.txt)
2.Combine train set and test set and read into the file "feature.txt" to give these data sets for variable name.
3.Give the variables of activity and subject a name, "Motion" and "SubjectID"
4.Extract all the variables with mean and standard deviation data. Pay attention, this data set exclude the variable with name "meanFreq" because I think they are not the mean or std of the raw data. So there are 66 variables in the dataset "data2".
5.Build a dataframe with beginning two variables"SubjectID" and "Motion", which specifiys every subject's every move. There are 180 rows in this data frame.(30 subjects and 6 motions.) And take the means for every combinantion of motion and subject in data2,put them into the data frame. So this data frame is the last result,"tidy data.txt"
